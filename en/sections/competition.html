		<h1>Description of the CRC competition</h1>
		<p>
			This year, the Robotic CRC has a new version of the competition: Robotic CRC TAKTIK. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This competition will be from Febuary 19 2025 to Febuary 22 2025. It's In Québec 9955 avenue Papineau, Montréal. The postal code of the place Is H2B 1Z9.
		</p>
		<p>
			The goal of this competition Is give a chance of young pepole of secondary and pepole In college to make a robot playing diferents parties allow to show there skills In more domains.
		</p>
		<p>
			This domains mention after with the arrows and there explication of themself.
		</p>

		<article id="game_description" class="grid_item">
			<h2>Game</h2>
			<p>
				The componant of the game Is the most important and the most advance with the CRC will permet the competitors to show thier competences In the game with the teamwork. It's possible to show the robot fonction In specific goal.
			</p>
			<p>
				In brief, the game Is a componant of CRC will post In big day the robot fonction for all's In more games.
			</p>
			<p>
				Considering the importance of this section, the game will have a section for herself because a simple description can't be resume all the componant like the rule for example.
			</p>
		</article>

		<article id="robot_description" class="grid_item">
			<h2>Robot design</h2>
			<p>
				The robot design Is a essential component to the robot operation because It creates the mecanisms like the wheels.
			</p>
			<p>
				The wheels should be make and adapted for the programmer. Also the robot design do create other essentiel component to her operation, but a section will be dedicated to understand how the robot was build. This robot Is the player of the game represent the school robot. To control It, You need a controller given by the CRC.
			</p>
			<p>
				In brief, the robot componant will allow the posibillity of all teams to participate of the game of this year and create the essential concepts to the adequate robot oparation.
			</p>

		<article id="programming_description" class="grid_item">
			<h2>Robot construction</h2>
			<p>
				The robot construction Is a another essential componant of the robot. It allow to the robot to move and It do fonction the robot mecanisms.
			</p>
			<p>
				The CRCduino do move the motors or another électronic componants, should make function the robot mecanisms. This year, the team use Arduino for the function of the CRCduino and they use a folder given by the CRC for function the CRCduino (The CRCLib). Also talk the programmation, more challenges organised by the CRC In python make In one sentence the programmation section.
			</p>
			<p>
				In brief, the robot construction use the electricity In order to permet electronic componant of the robot to function the robot.
			</p>

		<article id="kiosk_description" class="grid_item">
			<h2>Kiosk</h2>
			<p>
				The kiosk Isn't a obligatory section for the game of this year. The kiosk allow to schools the posibility to have space for them to view their theme of the year. This space delimited should be safe and it can show to the public what like there work and there robot. The delimited area from CRC for the kiosk and there theme can divide up In robot component, web site component, vidéo component and tutorial component.
			</p>
			<p>
				In brief, The kiosk Is a place where the team school show there theme like a save public place for all.

			<h2>Tutorial</h2>
			<p>
				The tutorial Isn't a obligatory componant of the CRC competition because It's not directely implicated to the game componant. This componant is ask to make a video explain how function the electronic current and explain the build steps of an complex mecanism.
			</p>
			<p>
				In brief, the tutorial allow to have a better explanations In robot of the school.
			</p>
			<p>
				We were unable to make a tutorial this year.
