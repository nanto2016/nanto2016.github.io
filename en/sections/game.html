		<h1>Game Description</h1>
		<p>
			This year's game involves taking donut-shaped discs (called GPs) and placing them in “stations” to earn points.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are two teams: blue and yellow, each made up of two robots.
		</p>
		<p>
			The GPs are located in dispensers that the robots can access. Each station is unique in how it awards points and how it can be “controlled.”
		</p>
		<details class="nice_border">
			<summary>Controlling the Stations</summary>
			<p>
				Each station can be controlled by a team based on the GPs placed there. Controlling stations can give a team a significant advantage, <i>but strategy is essential</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The playing field is made up of 9 stations arranged in a tic-tac-toe grid. Controlling 3 stations in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line multiplies the points earned from those stations for the controlling team.
			</p>
			<p>
				To better understand the "TakTik Toe Multipliers," check out the <a href="/en/sections/game.html#godot">interactive explanation of the game</a>.
			</p>
		</details>
		<p>
			There are 4 types of stations:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Post;</li>
			<li>The Inverted Post;</li>
			<li>The Horizontal Post;</li>
			<li>And the Curling Area.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For more information about the different types of stations, refer to the <a href="/en/sections/game.html#godot">game's interactive explanation</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, the interactive explanation does not cover the curling area, which is the most important station in the game.

			<summary>Curling Area</summary>

				<div class="text_with_image_sidebar">
					<p>
						The Curling Area is the most unique, challenging, and <i>rewarding</i> station.
					</p>
					<p>
						It consists of 4 concentric zones and a pole in the center. Robots are not allowed to enter this area.
					</p>
					<p>
						PJs thrown into one of the zones are worth a specific number of points based on the zone: the closer to the center, the more points. The first GP thrown onto the central pole is worth <b>500 POINTS!!!</b> Each subsequent GP is worth fewer points: 400, 300, 200… down to 0.
					</p>
					<p>
						The curling area is controlled by the team with the most GPs in the closest zone that contains at least one GP. For example, if the yellow team has 5 GPs in the 10-point zone and the blue team has 1 GP on the central pole, the blue team controls the curling area. If there is a tie, no team controls it.
