				<h2>September</h2>
				<p>
					The team gathers, anticipating the start of the competition.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					"The last two years have been tough, but we're ready to overcome the challenges this year."
				</blockquote>
			</div>

			<div id="october" class="comic_cell">
				<h2>October</h2>
				<p>
					Little by little, mysterious images are revealed by the CRC. The team analyses them without success.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					"Now that the game is revealed, I look back at the top-secret Tuesdays, and I don't really see any resemblance with the game... Guess we got tricked!"
				</blockquote>
			</div>
			
			<div id="kickoff" class="comic_cell">
				<h2>Kickoff</h2>
				<p>
					All participants were eagerly waiting for this moment to jump into action!
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					"I think my second favorite moment at the kickoff, after the explanation of the rules, was when we bought a pair of CRC socks. Awesome."
				</blockquote>
			</div>
			
			<div id="november" class="comic_cell">
				<h2>November</h2>
				<p>
					The work continues! Meetings, design, planning, construction...
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					"Nothing's more fun than throwing out a ton of ideas just after learning how the game of the year will work!"
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Website: The idea of an interactive explanation of TakTik 2025 is proposed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kiosk: We're searching for a theme... what will it be?
				</p>
				<p>
					Programming: The team decides not to participate in the preliminary challenges due to a lack of members.
				</p>
				<p>
					Video: It is agreed upon that a tutorial could easily be made, once the robot is built, showcasing one of its components.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="december" class="comic_cell">
				<h2>December</h2>
				<p>
					A theme is finally chosen for the team: "The Creative Industry"
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					"It's surprising that such a large school has so few resources for robotics... and on top of that, a good part of the team barely has time to get involved."
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Website: The interactive explanation proposed in November enters development. It is created using Godot.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kiosk: A character creation activity that would be put in the kiosk is considered.
				</p>
				<p>
					Video: Given that the idea of a "robotics weekend" has been suggested, the team plans to shoot the tutorial and the eventual video during that weekend.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="holidays" class="comic_cell">
				<h2>Holidays</h2>
				<p>
					The component that made the most progress during the holidays is the website: nearly the entire site you are currently reading was created over these two weeks!
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="january" class="comic_cell">
				<h2>january</h2>
				<p>
					Upon returning from the holidays, the team sees the competition approaching and doubles down on their efforts!
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					"We can't afford, for the third year in a row, to arrive at the competition without a robot. We need to get a working robot as quickly as possible."
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Website: Unfortunately, the preliminary deadlines are approaching, and the journey of the Industry cannot be documented further. The web team focuses on finalizing the writing and design.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kiosk: The instructions are clear... no kiosk without a robot. The Industry dedicates all its resources to the robot.
				</p>
				<p>
					Video: The same goes for the video team. The finance department, seeing the urgency of the situation, has ordered HR to transfer all employees to mechanics and programming!
