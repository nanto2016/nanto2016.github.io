				<h1>Description of the CRC Robotics Competition</h1>
				<p>
					The Kryptik 2024 robotics competition, organized by Robotique CRC, a program of AEST, allows young people from across Canada with interests in multiple fields such as programming, mechanics, artistic and technical design, languages, communication, and, of course, robotics, to compete with and against passionate individuals like themselves. The competition takes place from April 11th to 13th, 2024, at Curé-Antoine-Labelle High School for 3 days.
				</p>
				<p>
					The competition is divided into 7 components:
				</p>
				<button class="collapsible" onclick="collapse(0);">
					<p>↓ Game</p>
					<p class="descriptionText">
						In this component, participants must remotely control the robot they built to score maximum points according to this year's game. The challenge lies in planning and executing strategies that are well adapted to the robot and the rules of the game.
					</p>
				</button>
				<button class="collapsible" onclick="collapse(1);">
					<p>
						↓ Robot
					</p>
					<p class="descriptionText">
						The participants of the competition must conceptualize, build, and program a robot that will be used during matches. Rules state what can be used in the robot, but teams still have a great deal of freedom during the design phase.
					</p>
				</button>
				<button class="collapsible" onclick="collapse(2);">
					<p>
						↓ Kiosk
					</p>
					<p class="descriptionText">
						The booth emphasizes art and communication: participants must build a booth that will serve as an information point for the public and judges. It is strictly certified to ensure its structural integrity.
					</p>
				</button>
				<button class="collapsible" onclick="collapse(3);">
					<p>
						↓ Programming
					</p>
					<p class="descriptionText">
						This component aims to highlight programming as it is not as emphasized in the robot component. The goal is not to test participants' knowledge in a programming language but rather to test their problem-solving skills. Preliminary challenges are given in the season preceding the competition, and participants have a period of 2 or 3 weeks to solve each of them. However, the main challenge must be solved on-site during the competition and represents a greater challenge.
					</p>
				</button>
				<button class="collapsible" onclick="collapse(4);">
					<p>
						↓ Video
					</p>
					<p class="descriptionText">
						The video component involves creating a video with a maximum duration of 5 minutes that must briefly describe the CRC Robotics Competition and present its various components.
					</p>
				</button>
				<button class="collapsible" onclick="collapse(5);">
					<p>
						↓ Website
					</p>
					<p class="descriptionText">
						Here is the component that originated this document! It involves conceptualizing and programming a bilingual website that briefly describes the CRC Robotics Competition, explains this year's game and documents the robot creation process.
					</p>
				</button>
				<button class="collapsible" onclick="collapse(6);">
					<p>
						↓ Tutorial
					</p>
					<p class="descriptionText">
						This component emphasizes cooperation and knowledge sharing. Participants will need to create a bilingual tutorial video with a maximum duration of 3 minutes on a topic directly related to one of the competition's components.

					<h2>Game Description</h2>	 
					<p>
						Two teams (yellow and blue), each made up of two schools, will have to score by launching balls (there are 42, and are officially called Game Pieces, GP) into targets. If a ball is damaged by a robot, the faulty team has a penalty and must replace the GP.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now that we understand the general idea of the game, let's look at the score and penalties in detail. 
					</p>
					<p>
						But first of all, let's look at the roles occupied by participants and volunteers. there are three : the pilot, the co-pilot and the referee. The pilot of each team must control the robot and make it score, while his copilot watches the game, helping him count the number of balls loaded on the robot. The referee, who is neutral, must make sure the game goes well and the score is up to date. He is considered the expert of the game, so every decision taken by the referee is final. A team can contest such a decision in the following 15 minutes, given they have substantial proof. But don't abuse this right or you will lose it.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's important to understand the different penalties. To make this a bit simpler, here are the three major cases : 
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>If a team thinks that their robot needs assistance, the pilot may call the referee for aid, but the robot will receive a 20% score penalty.</li>
						<li>An aggressive behaviour towards another robot or a volunteer will result in a penatly determined by the head referee.</li>
						<li>If a robot loses a piece, it's team receives a 4% penalty. If a liquid leaks from a robot, it's score will be set <strong>DIRECTLY</strong> to zero.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Now that we know some rules, let's go more in-depth. On the terrain, there are two types of targets : the small ones and the tall ones. The small ones give 50 points when the ball goes through the hole and exits through the bottom layer (requires more precision), but otherwise it only gives 25 points. The tall target is worth 250 points. Can you reach even higher scores? Of course! There are cylindrical multiplier pillars. The more a team has balls on these pillars, the higher the score multiplier is, up to a maximum of 2.5 if the other team has no active pillars.
					</p>
					<p>
						And now, for the tournament structure : it seems to be made to help teams. The preliminary rounds last two days. What happens if you don't make it to the quarter-finals ? Are you eliminated ? Of course not! The knock-out rounds give you a second chance, but beware not to miss this chance. If you manage to increase your score enough, you're in the quarter-finals! After starting to dissassemble the kioks, it's now time for the finals, where only one team will thrive to victory... Which one? We're all eager to see!

				<h2>Component progress</h2>
				<p>When building the robot, the biggest problem was time. Up to very recently the mechanics teams had almost only prototypes for the weel system, but they made up for this by working very hard during spring break.</p>
				<p>We are sorry, but due to the little progress made up until now compared to what the finished robot will look like, we cannot efficiently describe the designing and building process. Try to imagine how the robot will look like using the pictures provided down below.</p>

					It has been turned upside down on this picture. The robot uses Mecanum wheels, which allows it to drive in any direction without turning.

				<h3>
					First GP gathering and launching module prototype
				</h3>
				<p>
					This one originally came from Mehmet, it is close to the systen that was chose, but here's one key difference: it combines the gathering and launching systems. Motors spin rubber bands that elevate the Game Pieces and they even spin fast enough to launch the balls.
				</p>

				<h3>
					GP gathering module schematics
				</h3>
				<p>
					Later on, we decided that it is a better idea to separate the gathering and launching systems, as they will function independently during the match. The main concept is the same, rubber bands act as two conveyor belts and elevate the GPs, then they are stored and launched by another system.

					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4>
								Marc-Alexandre
							</h4>
							<p>
								He became better at coding HTML, but faced difficulty in achieving good results. He solved this by delegating tasks effectively.
							</p>
							</li>
						<li>
							<h4>
								Yasmine

							<p>
								He learned better team management but faced a major challenge with a strike. He solved this by reactivating the team's mechanical hamster.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>
								Phœbe
							</h4>
							<p>She learned to code better for the robot presentation but encountered difficulties due to the lack of a system for coding the robot. She resolved this by adjusting and providing the best possible code. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>
								Antoine
